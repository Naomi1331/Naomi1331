            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            </p>My womens volleyball team has won many tournaments comming in either 1st or 2nd place. In middle school my girls volleyball team won state. One of my friends and I where both captains of that team that same year. On top of that I have had the privliage to be one of the capatains of my club volleyball team for the past 2 years.</p> 
            <h2>Time Line</h2>
            <p>I started playing volleyball In the year of 2018. This was in middle school and I made the B team at the time. For 2 years I was on the B team. 
               My last year which was 8th grade I was able to make the A team which was in 2022 and we won State champions being ranked the 9th seat beating the 2nd seat. That same year I
               joined a volleyball club and one of my friends and I where the captains. 
               This year as a freshmen I joined the Skyline Volleyball team and made the freshmen team (2023). I have now continued this passion by again going for the same club and am one of the captains and I plan on continuing with this passion.</p>
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>My Inspiration for me was my mom, grandma, &amp; brother. I would see my grandma play volleyball along with my mom and it looked so fun. My grandma was really good and my mom would always tell me that in highschool she would play with the team even tho she was not on it. She was th assistant. She started teaching my brother how to play and up till now he is really good. My mom was also the one to make me try out in middle school even though didn't really want to at first but it ended up being one of my favorite things to do and I have been able to make new friends thanks to that.</p>
